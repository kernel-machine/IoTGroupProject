# Second delivery update

## Comments received after the first delivery

- The concept idea doesn't solve a real world problem and so it wouldn't be a valuable product.
- The data collected by the sensors can be used in a more clever way.

## Changes done after the first delivery

Based on the feedback received after the first delivery we decided to start from scratch on a new concept idea: a smart marina.

## Technology update

### Work done up to now

We've developed the software for license plate recognition on a Raspberry Pi connected to an MQTT broker. We developed a DynamoDB storing the marina's boats information.

### Future work

## Evaluation update

### Work done up to now

We tested the power consumption and the delay in the license plate recognition.

### Future work
