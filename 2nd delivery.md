# Second delivery update

## Comments received after the first delivery

- The concept idea doesn't solve a real world problem and so it wouldn't be a valuable product.
- The data collected by the sensors can be used in a more clever way.

## Changes done after the first delivery

Based on the feedback received after the first delivery we decided to start from scratch on a new concept idea: a smart marina.

## Technology update

### Work done up to now

We've developed:
- Firmware for the screen controller
- Firmware for boat detection device
- Cloud software to control devices via MQTT
- Cloud software to assign reservation
- Software for license plate recognition

### Future work
- Web interface
- Security, all data stored in the database will be encrypted

## Evaluation update

### Work done up to now

We tested the power consumption and the delay in the license plate recognition.

### Future work
