## Brief description

During summer touristic marinas are full of amateur sailors that reserved a docking spot for spending the night. Since in many cases these people don't know well the place, reaching the correct docking spot in the marina can be stressful and dangerous given the big traffic. The IoT system that we propose uses an automatic boat identification method and some LCD screens to generate easily readable specific signage for each boat entering the marina. The docking spots assignment and the boats movements can be optimized also based on the sea pollution information collected by some water quality sensors.
