## Brief description

Traditional lighthouse are always on to signal the boats where the coast is, this is a big waste of energy and creates light pollution near the coast. Our new concept of lighthouse wants to eliminate these drawbacks without loss of the normal lighthouse functionality. The new smart lighthouse that we propose uses a low consumption light beam that is automatically pointed to the boats near the coast with the lowest intensity needed. In this way boats safety is preserved as well as the environment.
