#Evaluation 
A separate mark-down document in the repository (called "Evaluation") providing details on how to performance of the product/service will be evaluated, 
(i) during the development of the project, (ii) when the first complete version of the system will be ready for use. The document needs to describe the
evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components and define specific key performance indicators that will be measured,
tools that will be used.
The document should clearly address the following apsects:
The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies.
The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.
The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view.

##Evaluation of the performance during the devlopement of the project 

the performance of the product will be evaluated with  mesuring  the power consomption and comparing it to a traditional lighthouses
and also by the blue effect of this iot system  in the long term.

during the devloppement of the project the performance will be evaluated by mesuring the energy consomption and the size and accuracy of the data from :

  GPS: which have to send precise position in a short time and also have to send the strict minimum amount of data.
  FOG sensor : this sensor has to be precise on the sky visibility to  a precise computation with it's data and has to deal with the special wheather condition.

  photocell :this sensor has to tell if it's day or night on the location of the lighthouse. 

  light: has to have a good range and less energy consuming.   
  servo motor: has to fastly respond to the input variation and to be pretty precise on the rotation angle. 

##Evaluation of the performance after the first version of the project 
after the first version we will test if the beam is correctly set and fit the distance and the wheather conditions. 

the network technology should be wild range technology fast transfer of data and possibility of treating the data in cloud or at the nucleo board.

the time response of the beam from a user point of view should be fast and follow the position of the boat  and a clean guidence for the boat captain.
