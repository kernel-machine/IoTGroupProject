A separate mark-down document in the repository (called "Evaluation") providing details on how to performance of the product/service will be evaluated, 
(i) during the development of the project, (ii) when the first complete version of the system will be ready for use. The document needs to describe the
evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components and define specific key performance indicators that will be measured,
tools that will be used.
The document should clearly address the following apsects:
The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies.
The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.
The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view.


the performance of the product will be evaluated with the mesurement of the power consomption and comparing it to a traditional lighthouses
and also the affect on the bluegrove initiative in the long term 

during the devloppement of the project the performance will be evaluated by mesuring the size of the data and accuracy of data from :
GPS: the performence will be mesured depending in the accuracy and regularity of the data and also the size of the data also the power consomption 
FOG sensor : it's performence will be mesured depending on the precision of this sensor on detecting the fog and also the time response ad the size of the data reeived
              and by the possibilty of in dealing with the special wheather condition
              
photocell :size and periodicity of data 


during the devloppement of the project the performance of actuators will be evaluated from :
light: by mesuring the power used and by caculation the time response and ther precision of the calculation  
servo motor: the time response,and the precsion of the rotation angle


after the first version we will test if the boat are satisfied with the product and if the beam is correctly set and fit the distance and the wheather conditions 


the network technology should be wild range technology fast transfer of data and possibility of treating the data in cloud or at the nucleo board



the time response for a user point of view should be fast and following the position of the boat  and a clean guidence for the boat captain
