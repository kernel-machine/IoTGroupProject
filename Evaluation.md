## Evaluation:

During the long days of summers the touriste flock to marinas of each cost in the world, and because of the less informations and the croud in the marinas the tourists have problems to find a free spot and reach it.

our project will fix this probleme and to evaluate our solutio nwe satrt by the evaluation of the dvices performance :




### Devices Performance 

  -**Camera:** the performence of the camera will be evaluated by the  capablility of capturing clear images and  water-proof limits  and resistance to wheather conditions 

  -**oil spil sensor** : the performence of this Sensor sould be evaluated by detecting  precisely the ratio of floating oil in the marina

  -**boat detection** :should detect the presence of boat 

  -**screens** : the evaluation of this scrren will be by the capability to guide a novice touriste to right spot
  
  -**Dock Led:** this led should indicate if the place is busy or free 


### Network technology:

The marina server should be provaided by data via Lora and the data will be published from the server to the cloud via MQTT protocol 


### the response time from an end-user point of view: 

this IoT system have to indicate and help the user to find a free spot as soon as he reachs the marina and the indication should be clear and easy to follow from the user.
