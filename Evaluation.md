A separate mark-down document in the repository (called "Evaluation") providing details on how to performance of the product/service will be evaluated, (i) during the development of the project, (ii) when the first complete version of the system will be ready for use. The document needs to describe the evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components and define specific key performance indicators that will be measured, tools that will be used.
The document should clearly address the following apsects:
The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies.
The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency.
The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view.


## Devices Performance 

  -**Camera:** the performence of the camera will be evaluated by the  capablility of capturing clear images and  water-proof limits  and resistance to wheather conditions 

  -**oil spil sensor** : the performence of this Sensor sould be evaluated by detecting  precisely the ratio of floating oil in the marina

  -**boat detection** :should detect the presence of boat 

  -**screens** 
  
  -**Dock Led:** this led should indicate if the place is busy or free 


##Network technology:
The marina server should be provaided by data via Lora and the data will be published from the server to the cloud via MQTT protocol
