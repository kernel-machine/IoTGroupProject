# Concept

The concept behind this project is to create a smarter alternative to classical lighthouses on the coasts. With an orientable light beam is possible to warn the boats when they are getting near the coast with the minimum possible impact on the environment.

From the seaman point of view the interaction with the smart lighthouse is almost the same as with a classic one: when getting closer to the coast he sees a light on earth that can be used as landmark. Instead of seeing the light rotating toward him periodically he will see it pointing at him more often based on his needs.

## Personas

To make things more clear here we describe three personas who can benefit from the smart lighthouse.

### Captain of a cargo ship

John is the captain of a cargo ship that is going to reach the harbor in a few minutes. John has more than 20 year of experience and on his boat has a lot of sophisticate technologies that help him driving the boat near the coast, but, as all expert captains know, he knows that is better to use also the lighthouse on the coast as landmark. While getting closer to the harbor he sees more and more often the powerful light of the lighthouse pointing at him, so he uses it as an additional landmark to safely reach the harbor.

### Amateur sailor

Scott is a fishing addicted who likes to sail far from the coast at night, drop the anchor and spend one or two hours trying to catch the most delicious fishes of the gulf. He likes to stay on his boat relaxing in the peace of the sea at night. His boat his equipped with a GPS and wireless connectivity and so it can automatically communicate with the smart lighthouse. Using these informations the light of the lighthouse will be used only with the other moving boats, leaving Scott and his fishes in the tranquility of the night until he's ready to go back to the coast.

### Resident near the coast

Jeff is resident in a city with a beautiful gulf, his house has a lovely view on all the gulf with a big balcony where he likes to spend the summer evenings with his family. Even if during the day Jeff can see from his house the lighthouse on the other side of the gulf, at night his beautiful view is not ruined by a light that periodically points to his house, because the beam produced by the smart lighthouse never points toward his house.

## Storyboard

Here we explain with a simple storyboard how the interaction with the smart lighthouse can be.

- A man is driving a small boat at night
- He sees the light of the lighthouse periodically and uses it as landmark
- When he is far enough he stops and drops the anchor to fish
- While fishing on the spot he almost never see the light of the lighthouse
- When he starts the engine again to go back he sees the lighthouse again
- The closer to the coast he get, the more often he sees the light
